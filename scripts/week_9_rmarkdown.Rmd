This is an R Markdown document. I can type whatever I want.

**this is bold**
*this is italic*
### this will make the font smaller 
##this will make it slightly bigger 

Cheatsheet to these things here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf 

1) save this file 
2) to view in however it would be. use "knit" button 

HTML : online only
or knit it to a PDF or word doc to send to your PI (word can be funky)
PDF does require additional download to work 


You can click "insert" button for R or python or other code chunks 
OR ctrl+alt+i (PC)  cmd+option+i (MAC)
- use codechunk just like you would other script 

SETTINGS: tell it to just output i nthe consol not inlline 


TO not print when we knit ::
warning=faslse
message=false,
echo=FALSE (don't show code) 

or FUNCTION to do this "suppress" for a single library
  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
glimpse(storms)
library(viridis)

#create plot with pressure and something on xy axis 

ggplot(data=storms)+
  geom_jitter(aes(x= as.factor(month), y = pressure, fill=wind), pch= 21, alpha= .05)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title= "Hurricane Pressure v Month", subtitle = "with Max Wind Speed", x = "Month")


```

writing out equations in Rmarkdown: 

- some instances this requires packages like Latex 

If you want to write an equation, you put a $ on either side of it. 

$\sum_{i=y}^n X_i$

```{r}
library(knitr)

kable(head(storms),caption="table using kable")
htmlTable::htmlTable(head(storms))







#make an interactive table 
DT::datatable(storms)






library(plotly)  #lets you zoom, lasso, etc. nice to look for patterns! 
ggplotly(
  ggplot(data=storms)+
  geom_jitter(aes(x= as.factor(month), y = pressure, fill=wind), pch= 21, alpha= .05)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title= "Hurricane Pressure v Month", subtitle = "with Max Wind Speed", x = "Month"))

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
